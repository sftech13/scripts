    <title lang="en">Band of Brothers</title>
    <desc lang="en">Drawn from interviews with survivors of Easy Company, as well as their journals and letters, Band of Brothers chronicles the experiences of these men from paratrooper training in Georgia through the end of the war. As an elite rifle company parachuting into Normandy early on D-Day morning, participants in the Battle of the Bulge, and witness to the horrors of war, the men of Easy knew extraordinary bravery and extraordinary fear - and became the stuff of legend. Based on Stephen E. Ambrose's acclaimed book of the same name.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Generations have wondered if they could survive being stranded on a desert island. But how would people cope if they had to do it, for real, and with only themselves to rely on? It's a role reversal for Bear Grylls in this adventure series. Instead of himself attempting to survive harsh conditions in a remote location, Grylls abandons groups of British men and women on remote, uninhabited Pacific islands for a month and more. They will be completely alone, filming themselves, and with only the clothes they're wearing and some basic tools. The island may look like paradise but behind the beaches it can be hell on earth. When stripped of all the luxuries and conveniences of 21st-century living, does modern British man still have the spirit and resources to survive?</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Generations have wondered if they could survive being stranded on a desert island. But how would people cope if they had to do it, for real, and with only themselves to rely on? It's a role reversal for Bear Grylls in this adventure series. Instead of himself attempting to survive harsh conditions in a remote location, Grylls abandons groups of British men and women on remote, uninhabited Pacific islands for a month and more. They will be completely alone, filming themselves, and with only the clothes they're wearing and some basic tools. The island may look like paradise but behind the beaches it can be hell on earth. When stripped of all the luxuries and conveniences of 21st-century living, does modern British man still have the spirit and resources to survive?</desc>
