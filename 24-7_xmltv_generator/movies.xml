On the same day, his wife's lawyer pays him a visit, divorce papers in hand. His wife Tess has been selected to star in a show at a hotel to be built by the Las Vegas magnate Terry Benedict. Will Danny be able to outmaneuver Benedict, the ruler of Las Vegas who will stop at nothing to achieve his aims? Will he win back the heart of Tess, whom he still loves?

    <desc lang="en">The Spy Kids series is a series of family action-adventure films created by Robert Rodriguez. The main plot follows the adventures of two Cortez children who become involved in their parents' espionage. The rest of their family are spies as well, including their estranged uncle Machete and maternal grandparents. All films tend to have a strong Hispanic heritage theme, as Rodriguez is of Mexican descent, though the dialogue is predominately in English. McDonald's released Spy Kids toys in Happy Meals by the time all four films were released.</desc>
